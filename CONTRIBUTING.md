## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality

Specifically:

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It adheres to the code style and terminology used in the project (feel free to file an issue discussing this code style), use `npm run lint` to achieve proper formatting.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/), This repository has a code of conduct, I will remove things that do not respect it.
